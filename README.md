# Multitarget Tracking for HEXD Data

This repository implements a multitarget tracking system for tracking spots in 3D space, specifically designed for high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXD) data. The system uses Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) and supports real-time detection and tracking of overlapping spots.
